\section{TERMS}
Radiation is energy that comes from a source and travels through some material or through
space. Light, heat, and sound are sorts of radiation. Atom-derived radiation is termed radiation
because it can produce charged particles (ions) in matter.
Contamination means radioactive materials within the sort of gasses, liquids, or solids are
released into the environment and contaminate people externally, internally, or both. An external
surface of the body, like the skin, can become contaminated, and, if radioactive materials get
inside the body through the lungs, gut, or wounds, the contaminant can become deposited
internally.
\section{Radiation induced injury both for civilians and clinical personnel }
external irradiation, contamination with radioactive materials, and incorporation of radioactive
material into body cells, tissues, or organs. External irradiation occurs when all or part of the
body is exposed to penetrating radiation from an external source. During exposure, this
radiation can be absorbed by the body or it can pass completely through. A similar thing occurs
during an ordinary chest x ray. Following external exposure, an individual is not radioactive and
can be treated like any other patient,External radiation does not make a person radioactive. The
second type of radiation injury involves contamination with radioactive materials.An external
surface of the body, such as the skin, can become contaminated, and, if radioactive materials
get inside the body through the lungs, gut, or wounds, the contaminant can become deposited
internally. A person is externally contaminated if radioactive material is breathed in, swallowed,
or absorbed through wounds. The environment is contaminated if radioactive material is spread
about or uncontained. The third type of radiation injury that can occur is incorporation of
radioactive material. Incorporation refers to the uptake of radioactive materials by body cells,
tissues, and target organs such as bone, liver, thyroid, or kidney.
\section{ Summary }
In general, radioactive materials are distributed throughout the body based upon their chemical
properties. Incorporation cannot occur unless contamination has occurred. The three types of
exposure can happen in combination and can be complicated by physical injury or illness. In
such a case, serious medical problems always have priority over concerns about radiation (such
as radiation monitoring, contamination control, and decontamination).
