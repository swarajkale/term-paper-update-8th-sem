\section{PROLIFERATION}
Despite arms control regimes, transfer of NBC weapons technology and material
continues among well established states, such as Russia and China, and third world NBC
proliferation. Russian President Yeltsin fired General Anatoly Kuntsevich, former Deputy
Commander of the Soviet CBR Troops,
in April 1994 from his position as
Chairman, President’s Committee on
Biological and Chemical Weapons. The same month, charges were drawn up
against Kuntsevich for attempting to transfer CW agent precursors to Syria. North Korea has
delivered hundreds of SCUD missiles and production technology to Iran and Syria. China sent
M-11 missile related technology to Pakistan, and nuclear, CW and missile technology to
Iran.Iran supplied the CW agent to Libya, which Libya
used against Chad in 1987.
\section{History}
In closing, we have to that nations divert technology for legitimate development to NBC
weapons programs. Most of these programs are pursued in regions of the world where balances
of power, as understood in the European sense, do not exist. When these weapons are used or
threatened, regional conflicts quickly escalate to international concern and complicate efforts at
crisis resolution. Military operations are made more difficult when an NBC capable enemy can
deny the use of terrain and force our soldiers into protective gear. Movement, communications,
and even the simplest soldier tasks become vastly difficult in an NBC environment. As new
missions point our forces toward the world’s trouble spots, our capability to fight and win on the
NBC battlefield becomes increasingly important..
