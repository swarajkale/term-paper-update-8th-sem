\section{The Practical Risks and Effects of Using Radiological Weapons}
There is no question that small amounts of radioactive materials can be used to attack, threaten,
and contaminate, and that the risk of radiation poses a serious psychological problem. Covert
attacks might produce slow radiation poisoning, and agents might be deliberately designed to
make cost-effective decontamination difficult, time-consuming, or impossible.
\section{ Problems }
The limited use of small amounts of radiological weapons present the problem that there are no
reliable criteria for determining what dose is dangerous or lethal, particularly if effects like
long-term increases in the cancer rate are included. Responders also differ sharply in terms of
their use of sophisticated radiation detectors, and most responders are far more concerned with
evacuation than the difficult problems of dealing with medical and decontamination aftermaths.
In broad terms, however, these effects are somewhat similar to those of using a chemical
weapon. They are not catastrophic, and even the contamination of most critical facilities could
be dealt
\section{ Summary }
One possible option is a systematic attack on a nuclear power plant. This would require
considerable expertise, access to the basic design of the plant and ideally to a full set of plans,
and either an exceptionally efficient saboteur or a trained team. In most cases, it would require
considerable time and effort to bypass safeguards and controls. The possible venting or
overload of a reactor could then act as a radiological weapon, however, and cover hundreds of
square kilometers as well as have a major potential effect on regional power supplies and some
aspects of the nuclear program.
